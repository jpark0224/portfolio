## Introduction

A portfolio website that showcases my achievements and projects. This was my first project built with TypeScript and was designed responsive across all devices. The project took 1 week of web design and 2 weeks of coding after work. The website has been deployed with Netlify and connected to a custom domain: https://juliepark.dev/.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- TypeScript
- React 18
- Bootstrap 5
- Libraries
  - React Scroll Parallax
  - React-Scroll
  - EmailJS

## Process

### Planning

- Wireframing
  - I started the project by building a wireframe of the website. Figma was used. The link of the wireframe is below: https://www.figma.com/file/9130RETN6VcUI1YasFXWy6/Portfolio-Wireframe
  - I had one week to design my website. My objectives were to make the website which 1) is esthetically pleasing without compromising the performance 2) provides all the information at a glance 3) is easy to navigate.
  - I researched portfolio websites made by experienced developers. This helped me come up with the basic structure and design of the website.
  - Pinterest was used to research static website design references.
  - Coolers and Adobe Color were used to choose the colour palette of the website.
  - I found it significantly easier to build a website with concrete images of the final product established.
- Project management
  - OneNote was used throughout the process to organise ideas and keep track of a checklist of tasks to complete and to be completed.
- Structuring React folders
  - Made three folders in the src folder: assets, styles, and components.
  - Made separate components per page.
  - Made separate css files per page. In my previous projects, I used one css file for all the components which made it difficult to find a class or id when I wanted to change the style. Having separate css files made it much easier to navigate.
  - Made one styles.css file for styles applied throughout the website
